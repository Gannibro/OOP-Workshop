# Workshop 2: Move and Copy Semantics
In this workshop, you work with a large dynamically allocated array of C++ Standard Library strings and compare the performance of copy and move operations on that collection.


# Learning Outcomes:
* retrieve records from a text file using an input file stream object
* count the number of records in a text file
* monitor the time spent on a particular task using the std::chrono library
* implement copy semantics for a class with a resource
* implement move semantics for a class with a resource
* identify the processing-intensive operations in copy and move assignments

# Output of Programs:
The desired output of the written programs are to be compared to the provided sample outputs labelled as:
* sample_output_P1
* sample_output_P2

# Compiling and running:
The program needs to be compiled using the "g++" compiler with the command "g++ -o ws w2_p1.cpp -std=c++11" which compiles the code using C++ version 11.
To run the program, the command ".ws/proteinsequences.txt" must be executed.
